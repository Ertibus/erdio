# ErdIO
A turn-based game inspired by [_"Invicible, Inc."_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/243970/Invisible_Inc/).

# Features
- 3D
- Turn-based grid movement (_A* pathfinding_).
- Random map generation.


# Tools
- [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org/) - A data-driven game engine built in Rust.
- [Fyrox Engine](https://rg3d.rs/) - A feature-rich and easy-to-use game engine written in the Rust programming language (As backup if Bevy doesn't work)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - programming language
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)- Modeling
- [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/)- Texture editing

- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)- OS

# Assets
- For testing perposes I'll use freely available [Kenney's assets](https://kenney.nl/assets)

# Limitations
- Since __Bevy Engine__ is still in the _prototyping phase_ some features are missing. Most notably: skeletal animations. As so, the game will not contain animations.
